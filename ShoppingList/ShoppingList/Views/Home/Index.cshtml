        <h2>What happens when clicking the Shopping List Tab</h2>
        <p>
            This will allow you to see the different shopping list that you have stored. You would create a different
            list for each store that you are shopping at or each department. This way you can go into one list for
            your groceries and show or edit that list without looking at all the other items at the other stores.
